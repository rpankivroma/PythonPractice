# Task from ChatGPt: Multiple Statements and Indentation
# Write a Python program that:
# Stores two numbers in variables a and b.
# On one line, assigns values 10 to a and 20 to b.
# Uses an if statement to check if b is greater than a.
# If true, print: b is greater than a
# Make sure your indentation is correct.

# Answer:

a = 10
b = 20

if b > a :
    print("b is greater than a")

# Output from terminal:
# PS C:\Users\trade> & C:/Users/trade/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python314/python.exe 
# "c:/Users/trade/Desktop/PythonPractice/PythonPractice/Python Syntax.py"
# b is greater than a
